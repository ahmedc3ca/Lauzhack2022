# Green Receipts

## Inspiration
Our app aims to provide users with an easy and convenient way to see the environmental impact of their grocery purchases and make more sustainable choices.

## Features
- take a picture of a grocery receipt and instantly see the carbon footprint of the purchase
- track the user's carbon footprint over time, so they can see how their choices are impacting the environment
- highlight the most and least environmentally-friendly products in the receipt so the user can make informed choices

## How we built it
- extract relevant data from the receipt using OCR
- query a database of products and their corresponding carbon footprints to calculate the total carbon footprint of the purchase

## Challenges we ran into
- ensuring that our carbon footprint estimations are accurate for the wide range of products available in a grocery store
- smooth integration of camera in app

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
- made a phone call and managed to obtain access to a database with a detailed breakdown of carbon emissions
- organizing ourselves in a hybrid team

## What we learned
- Android development
- interacting with APIs
- moving from design to fully functional MVP

## What's next for Green Receipts
- recommendations for more sustainable product alternatives
- integrating price data
- adaptation to specific grocery store websites to get more accurate estimates
- leaderboard
